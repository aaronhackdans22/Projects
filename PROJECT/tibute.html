<h3>Here is a timeline of Jane Goodall's life</h3>
<ul>
    <li>934 - Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall, known as
        <br>Jane Goodall, was born on April 3, 1934 in</br>
        <br> London, England.</br>
    </li>
    <li> 1941 - Inspired by The Story of Dr. Doolittle, she 
        <br> dreamt of going to Africa to study animals one</br> 
        <br> day.</br></li>
    <li>1952 - She got a job as a typist at Oxford
        <br> University. She later worked for a film studio. </br></li>
    <li>1956 - An opportunity that changed her life. She
        <br> was invited by a friend to visit their family farm</br>
        <br> in Kenya, Africa.</br></li>
    <li> 1957 - At age 23, Jane set foot in Africa. In Kenya
        <br> she met a famous anthropologist, Dr. Louis</br>
        <br> Leakey, who eventually hired her to be his </br>
        <br> secretary at the Coryndon Museum (now the </br>
        <br> National Museum of Kenya) in Nairobi.</br>
        <br> Recognising her talent, he decided she was the</br>
        <br>right person to take on a study of chimps in the </br>
        <br> Gombe Stream Reserve in Tanzania. When Jane</br>
        <br>  returned to England, Dr. Leakey began raising</br>
        <br>  funds for the project.</br></li>
    <li>1960 - Jane, accompanied by her mother, set up
        <br> camp at the Gombe Stream Reserve in </br>
        <br> Tanzania. Jane spent hours every day observing </br>
        <br> the chimpanzees, noting down their dietary</br>
        <br>  habits and food-gathering ingenuity. In </br>
        <br> November, her mother returned to England.</br></li>
    <li>1962 - With Dr. Leakey's help, Jane was 
        <br>accepted into a programme at Cambridge</br>
        <br> University. After her first term, Jane headed</br>
        <br> back to Africa. This time, she met Baron Hugo</br>
          <br>   van Lawick, a photographer/filmmaker from the</br>
          <br>  National Geographic magazine. She was his</br>
          <br>  assignment - he took pictures of her while she </br>
          <br>  worked.
    </li>
    <li>1964 - On March 28, 1964 Jane and Hugo 
        <br> wedded. They returned to Gombe to continue </br>
        <br> researching chimps.</br></li>
    <li>1967 - In March of 1967, Jane gave birth to her
        <br> son, Hugo. They nicknamed him "Grub."</br></li>
    <li>1966 - She graduated from Cambridge and 
        <br> became professionally known as Dr. Jane </br>
        <br> Goodall.</br></li>
    <li>1974 - Jane and Hugo divorced. This same year,
        <br> Jane observed that chimps waged war on other</br>
        <br> groups of chimps, and even carried out </br>
        <br> cannibalism.</br></li>
    <li>1975 - Jane met Derek Bryceson, the head of
        <br> the Tanzanian National Park, and married him.</br>
        <br>  Unfortunately, soon after the wedding, Derek </br>
        <br> died of cancer.</br></li>
    <li>1977 to present - Jane 
        <br> founded the Jane Goodall Institute to help people understand the</br>
        <br> importance of preserving the forests and the</br>
        <br> animals who lived in them. Over the years </br>
        <br> several programs have developed to help others </br>
        <br> realise that they, too, can make a difference in </br>
        <br> the world around them.</br></li>
