<h1>WELCOME TO GHANA "THE LAND OF PEACE" </h1>

	<h2>ABOUT GHANA</h2>
		<P>
			<br><strong>Ghana</strong> was the first place in <em>sub-Saharan Africa</em> <br>where Europeans arrived to trade - first in gold, later in slaves.</br></br><br> It was also the first black African nation in the region to achieve independence from a colonial power,</br> in this instance Britain.</br>

<br>Despite being rich in mineral resources, and endowed with a good education system and efficient civil service,</br><br> Ghana fell victim to corruption and mismanagement soon after independence in 1957.</br>

	<h3>HISTORY</h3>
 
Ghana's independence square
<br>Ghana was formerly known as the <em>Gold Coast</em>. </br><br>On 6 March 1957 <strong>Kwame Nkrumah</strong> 
 declared the country's independence.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ghana"> brief history of Ghana</a> On 1 July 1960,</br><br> Ghana became a commonwealth republic with Nkrumah as the first President of the country.</br><br> 

<div>The flag of Ghana consists of the colours red, gold, green, and the black star.</br>
<img  src="./ghana-flag.jpg" height="150" width="150 " style="float: center; "></div>

<br>In 1966 its first president and pan-African hero, Kwame Nkrumah, was deposed in a coup,<br> heralding years of mostly-military rule. In 1981 Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings staged his second coup.</br><br> The country began to move towards economic stability and democracy.</br>

<br>In April 1992 a constitution allowing for a multi-party system was approved in a referendum, </br><br>ushering in a period of democracy. A well-administered country by regional standards,</br><br> Ghana is often seen as a model for political and economic reform in Africa.</br>

Challenges
  
<br>Poverty is still endemic in Ghana</br>
<br>Although Ghana’s growth has been fairly robust, the source of growth has always been biased in favour </br><br>of extractive and capital intensive services sector which do not have direct poverty reducing effect.</br><br> Poverty endemic areas are often constrained by basic infrastructure such as feeder roads that links their economic activity,</br><br> mostly farming, to urban market centres.</br>
<br><strong>Malaria</strong> still remains a public health concern as it is the leading cause of morbidity in Ghana.</br><br> There are still challenges in meeting the goal of reducing maternal mortality ratio</br><br> to the expected 185 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015.</br><br>There are rural‐urban disparities in health care services.</br><br> Moreover, there is still significant number of children of primary school age </br><br>not enrolled and significant enrolment gaps also remain between the poorest and the wealthiest children.</br>
